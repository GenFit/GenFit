/** @brief Class for measurements in wire detectors (Straw tubes and drift chambers)
 *  which do not measure the coordinate along the wire.
 *
 *  @author Tobias Schl체ter
 *
 * This is similar to WireMeasurement, but since WireMeasurement
 * stores a 7x7 covariance matrix for what is a one-dimensional
 * measurement, this class is preferable.  Protected inheritance of
 * rawHitCoords_ and rawHitCov_ makes it impossible to rewrite
 * WireMeasurement, as subclasses will access these members.
 *
 * This hit class is not valid for arbitrary choices of plane
 * orientation: to use it you MUST choose a plane described by u
 * and v axes with v coincident with the wire (and u orthogonal
 * to it, obviously).
 * The hit will be described by 7 coordinates:
 * w_x1, w_y1, w_z1, w_x2, w_y2, w_z2, rdrift
 * where w_ji (with j = x, y, z and i = 1, 2) are the wire
 * extremities coordinates; rdrift = distance from the wire (u
 * coordinate in the plane)
 *

  /**  Hits with a small drift distance get a higher weight, whereas hits with
    * big drift distances become weighted down.
    * When these initial weights are used by the DAF, the smoothed track will be closer to the real
    * trajectory than if both sides are weighted with 0.5 regardless of the drift distance.
    * This helps a lot when resolving l/r ambiguities with the DAF.
    * The idea is that for the first iteration of the DAF, the wire positions are taken.
    * For small drift radii, the wire position does not bend the fit away from the
    * trajectory, whereas the wire position for hits with large drift radii is further away
    * from the trajectory and will therefore bias the fit if not weighted down.
