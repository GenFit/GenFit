 * The Kalman Filter operates on genfit GFTrack objects. It is an implementation
 * of the Kalman Filter algebra that uses the genfit interface classes 
 * GFAbsRecoHit and GFAbsTrackRep in order to be independent from the specific
 * detector geometry and the details of the track parameterization /
 * track extraoplation engine.
 *
 * The Kalman Filter can use hits from several detectors in a single fit 
 * to estimate the parameters of several track representations in parallel.
