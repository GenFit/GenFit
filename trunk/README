After your checkout you will also have a geane3 directory, which is CERN's VMC with geant3.

Set up a ROOT installation (I tested only with 5.24) (ROOTSYS PATH ...)

export GENFIT=yourInstallDir
export VMC=$GENFIT/geant3

./makeEnv.sh

. env.sh (do this every time you open a new shell after setting up ROOT to run and compile GENFIT)

cmake .

make (if you do make -j2 or higher, you will get a linker error, since the second lib will be linked to the first which takes longer to compile - just make again)

you now all libs in $GENFIT/lib, which is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH


You can run the two examples in the examples directory. There is no more documentation on the usage of the code than just those examples. Please ask me if anything is unclear. The basic idea of the examples is to use one trackrep to generate hits along a track, which are then smeared and reconstructed. In your real application you will of course get the hits from an external simulation.

go to the directory $GENFIT/example/XX

cmake .

make

root makeGeom.C (which will make a geometry as TGeoManager - look inside the script about how to make geometries, and where the media are defined)

./main

the examples produce out.root

to analyze out.root, do

root our.root
.L pullsOld.C
pulls p
p.Loop()

Please feel free to add to this very rudimentary readme file
