 *  You have to set which energy-loss and noise mechanisms you want to use.

    *  - with respect to #directionBefore: #noiseBefore, which is then propagated with the jacobian
    *  - with respect to #directionAfter: #noiseAfter
    *  The mean value of these two matrices is added to the noise matrix #noise.
    *  This method gives better results than either calculating only noiseBefore or noiseAfter.
    *  \n\n
    *  This is a detailed description of the mathematics involved:
    *  \n
    *
    *  The angles from the spherical coordinates \phi and \theta are identical to the scattering angles used in this
    *  routine. Therefore the transformation from spherical to carthisean coordinates can be used to project the MSC variances
    *  to the  global covariance matrix. This is the approch used in "Data Analysis Techniques for High-Energy Physics"
    *  by Fr√ºhwirth and Regel phapter 3.3.2.2 "Weight Martrix formalism for multiple scattering". The formulas
    *  in the code are adapted formulas from this chapter.
    *
    * Now two \f$N\f$ are calculated: \f$N_{before}\f$ (at the start point, with initial direction #directionBefore)
    * and \f$N_{after}\f$ (at the final point, with direction #directionAfter).
    * \f$N_{before}\f$ is the propagated with the #jacobian of extrapolation \f$T\f$.
    * The new covariance matrix with multiple scattering in global cs is:
    *
    * \f{eqnarray*}
    * C_{new} & = C_{old} + 0.5 \cdot T N_{before} T^{T} + 0.5 \cdot N_{after} \f}
