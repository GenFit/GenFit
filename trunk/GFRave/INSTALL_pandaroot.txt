- make a directory where you want to install rave
- put this into your .bashrc
    export RAVEPATH=...
- check out and build rave: 
    cd $RAVEPATH
    svn co http://svn.hepforge.org/rave/trunk ./
    cd $PANDAPATH/GenfitTools/GFRave
    . install_rave.sh
    
- now comes the more complicated part, but this will become easier in the near future. The following files have to be changed, if you are at TUM E18, please take a look at my pandaroot and copy the changes: /nfs/hicran/project/panda/SIM/jrauch/clean 
- tpc/tpcreco/CMakeLists.txt
- tpc/tpcreco/tpcrecoLinkDef.h
- GenfitTools/CMakeLists.txt
- gconfig/rootlogon.C
