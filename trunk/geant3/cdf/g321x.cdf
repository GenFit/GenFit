Clipping commands.
The hidden line removal technique is necessary to visualize properly
very complex detectors. At the same time, it can be useful to visualize
the inner elements of a detector in detail. For this purpose, the
commands menu CVOL has been developed: these commands allow
subtractions (via boolean operation) of given shapes from any part of
the detector, therefore showing its inner contents. It is possible
to clip each different volume by means of a different shape (BOX ,
TUBE, CONE, SPHE are available). If '*' is given as the name of the
volume to be clipped, all volumes are clipped by the given shape.
A volume can be clipped at most twice (even by
different shapes); if a volume is explicitely clipped
twice, the '*' will not act on it anymore. Giving '.' as the name
of the volume to be clipped will reset the clipping.

>Action GXDRAW
 
>Menu /GEANT/DRAWING
>Guidance
Drawing commands. These commands allow the visualization in several ways
of the volumes defined in the geometrical data structure. It is possible
to draw the logical tree of volumes belonging to the detector (DTREE),
to show their geometrical specification (DSPEC,DFSPC), to draw them
and their cut views (DRAW, DCUT). Moreover, it is possible to execute
these commands when the hidden line removal option is activated; in
this case, the volumes can be also either translated in the space
(SHIFT), or clipped by boolean operation (CVOL). In addition, it is
possible to fill the surfaces of the volumes
with solid colours when the shading option (SHAD) is activated.
Several tools (ZOOM, LENS) have been developed to zoom detailed parts
of the detectors or to scan physical events as well.
Finally, the command MOVE will allow the rotation, translation and zooming
on real time parts of the detectors or tracks and hits of a simulated event.
Ray-tracing commands. In case the command (DOPT RAYT ON) is executed,
the drawing is performed by the Geant ray-tracing;
automatically, the color is assigned according to the tracking medium of each
volume and the volumes with a density lower/equal than the air are considered
transparent; if the option (USER) is set (ON) (again via the command (DOPT)),
the user can set color and visibility for the desired volumes via the command
(SATT), as usual, relatively to the attributes (COLO) and (SEEN).
The resolution can be set via the command (SATT * FILL VALUE), where (VALUE)
is the ratio between the number of pixels drawn and 20 (user coordinates).
Parallel view and perspective view are possible (DOPT PROJ PARA/PERS); in the
first case, we assume that the first mother volume of the tree is a box with
dimensions 10000 X 10000 X 10000 cm and the view point (infinetely far) is
5000 cm far from the origin along the Z axis of the user coordinates; in the
second case, the distance between the observer and the origin of the world
reference system is set in cm by the command (PERSP NAME VALUE); grand-angle
or telescopic effects can be achieved changing the scale factors in the command
(DRAW). When the final picture does not occupy the full window,
mapping the space before tracing can speed up the drawing, but can also
produce less precise results; values from 1 to 4 are allowed in the command
(DOPT MAPP VALUE), the mapping being more precise for increasing (VALUE); for
(VALUE = 0) no mapping is performed (therefore max precision and lowest speed).
The command (VALCUT) allows the cutting of the detector by three planes
ortogonal to the x,y,z axis. The attribute (LSTY) can be set by the command
SATT for any desired volume and can assume values from 0 to 7; it determines
the different light processing to be performed for different materials:
0 = dark-matt, 1 = bright-matt, 2 = plastic, 3 = ceramic, 4 = rough-metals,
5 = shiny-metals, 6 = glass, 7 = mirror. The detector is assumed to be in the
dark, the ambient light luminosity is 0.2 for each basic hue (the saturation
is 0.9) and the observer is assumed to have a light source (therefore he will
produce parallel light in the case of parallel view and point-like-source
light in the case of perspective view).

 CALL GDRAW(name,theta,phi,psi,u0,v0,su,sv)
If optional parameters are missing, the corresponding values are
taken from the common /GCDRAW/. This command will draw the volumes,
selected with their graphical attributes, set by the SATT
facility. The drawing may be performed with hidden line removal
and with shading effects according to the value of the options HIDE
and SHAD; if the option SHAD is ON, the contour's edges can be
drawn or not. If the option HIDE is ON, the detector can be
exploded (BOMB), clipped with different shapes (CVOL), and some
of its parts can be shifted from their original
position (SHIFT). When HIDE is ON, if
the drawing requires more than the available memory, the program
will evaluate and display the number of missing words
(so that the user can increase the
size of its ZEBRA store). Finally, at the end of each drawing (with HIDE on),
the program will print messages about the memory used and
statistics on the volumes' visibility.
The following commands will produce the drawing of a green
volume, specified by NAME, without using the hidden line removal
technique, using the hidden line removal technique,
with different linewidth and colour (red), with
solid colour, with shading of surfaces, and without edges.
Finally, some examples are given for the ray-tracing. (A possible
string for the NAME of the volume can be found using the command DTREE).

ZZZZ  ' Shift along Z axis                  ' R  D=0.
>Guidance
To draw a volume shifted from its initial position when hidden
line removal is ON. It can be useful if you want to extract a
volume or some volumes from the detector to show them more clearly.
The last requested SHIFT for each volume
NAME is performed. Moreover, the SHIFT of
each volume will be performed starting from where its mother has
been shifted, so that it's easier to SHIFT nicely sets
of volumes using the mother-daughter relationships.
If '.' is given as the name of the volume
to be shifted, the shifts for all volumes will be reset.
The following commands will produce the translation along
the Z-axis of the previously drawn volume:
 EXAMPLE -
 dopt hide on
 satt * seen -2
 draw NAME 40 40 0 10 10 .01 .01
 shift NAME 0 0 10
 
>Action GXDRAW
 
>Command BOMB
>Parameters
BOOM  ' Exploding factor for volumes position ' R  D=0. R=-10.:10.
>Guidance
To 'explode' the detector. If BOOM is positive (values smaller
than 1. are suggested, but any value is possible)
all the volumes are shifted by a distance
proportional to BOOM along the direction between their centre
and the origin of the MARS; the volumes which are symmetric
with respect to this origin are simply not shown.
BOOM equal to 0 resets the normal mode.
A negative (greater than -1.) value of
BOOM will cause an 'implosion'; for even lower values of BOOM
the volumes' positions will be reflected respect to the origin.
This command can be useful to improve the 3D effect for very
complex detectors. The following commands will make explode the
detector:
 EXAMPLE -
 dopt hide on
 satt * seen 1
 draw NAME 40 40 0 10 10 .01 .01

ISELT  'Options    ' I D=111
>Guidance
This command allows the drawing of the logical tree,
displaying the name, the multiplicity and other information about the volumes,
via a call to GDTREE(name,levmax,isel):
if the third parameter is not given (default), the command will
produce the drawing of the tree displaying, for each volume, the
number of the following levels (red arrows) and of the preceeding
levels (green arrows); then the control is automatically given to the
mouse: clicking on the left button when the cursor is inside a volume's
pave will perform a DSPEC for that volume; doing the same when the cursor
is on a red arrow, will perform a DTREE for the relative volume (the
number of levels displayed depending on the clicked arrow); doing the
same for the 'i-th' green arrow of a given volume, will perform a DTREE
for its mother-volume staying 'i' levels before.
If running with X-windows, the drawing of the specification (DSPEC)
is performed
in a different window to speed up the scanning of the tree.
Iterating this procedure it is possible to analyse very easily and quickly
any kind of tree. Clicking the right button of the mouse will return
the control to the command mode.
If the ISELT parameter is given,
then the TREE will work as in the
previous version, with ISELT up to 10001.
The following command will perform a drawing of the tree and give the
control to the user via the mouse:

Position the cursor on the first point (u1,v1) and hit the space bar(GKS).
Position the cursor on the second point (u2,v2) and hit the space bar(GKS).
Clicking the left button of the mouse (X11) will have the same effect as
hiting the space bar (GKS).
The command will compute and print the distance in space separating
the two points on the projection view. It can be useful to measure
distances either between volumes or between tracks or hits.

>Parameters
>Guidance
Activates graphic input to identify detector elements
in a cut view. Clicking on the left button of the mouse when
the cursor is in a given point of the drawing and clicking again
(outside the detector) will produce the following effect:
a line joininig the two points will be drawn together with
the name and the medium number of the volume picked
with the first clicking close to the second point.

>Guidance
Positioning some daughter volumes inside a 'mother', it can be
important to check if overlaps between such volumes have occurred.
Instead of putting the drawing in a view bank, zooming, and iterating
the process for different viewing angles of the same detector, the
MOVE facility has been developed (for machines running with X11):
it is sufficient to draw a view of the volumes to be analysed (after
setting the proper SEEN, COLO, etc. attributes) and then to enter
'MOVE' followed by the same 'NAME' used for the last command DRAW.
The detector will appear in a panel with five buttons at the
bottom: THETA, PHI, TRASL, ZOOM, OFF. Clicking on the left button
of the mouse, when the cursor is inside the THETA area, will rotate the
detector along the polar angle theta according to the
backward-to-forward movement of the mouse
(clicking up and down the left button if
not in sample mode); clicking on the right button of
the mouse will stop the rotation; clicking now on the
left button of the mouse when inside the PHI area will activate a
rotation along the polar angle phi. In the same way, activating the
TRASL button, the detector can be translated in the u,v plane
of the screen according to the 2D-movement of the mouse. Finally,
activating the ZOOM button, the detector will be zoomed (or unzoomed)
according to the backward-to-forward movement of the mouse. Clicking on the
OFF button will return the control to the 'command mode'. The MOVE
command will work also with hidden line removal and shading options
(when SHAD is on the background will be black);
moreover, if the volumes are clipped, exploded, shifted, etc., they
will be 'MOVED' with these features as well.
Tracks and hits of a previously stored physical event can be moved
together with the detector, allowing a dynamical 3-D analysis of the
simulated events. Clicking the central button of the mouse when a good
view of the event is found, will stop any movement and the mouse will
allow the normal picking capabilities first for the tracks and then for
the hits. After clicking of the right button, the normal
movement will restart to find another interesting view of the event
and to iterate the process.
The MOVE is also available in sample mode.
The following commands will produce a drawing of a volume
and then will give the control to the MOVE panel; try the following
possibilities:

Interactive zooming for detectors and events when running
with X-windows. Using this command, when showing the contents of a
view bank, it is possible to click (left button) in two points of the
drawing (which will represent the left upper corner and the right
bottom corner of the part to be zoomed). After the second click
a new 'window' will appear to fit the frame defined
by the two clicks and it will show a zoomed view as seen from a
lens with those dimensions. Clicking now the central button will
translate the lens over the drawing, while clicking the right button
will stop it. Moreover, clicking the left button of the
mouse, the lens will increase (or decrease) its magnification
power according to the backward-to-forward movement of the mouse.
A click on the right button will stop this action and it is possible
to restart the translation of the lens or, clicking
on the right button again, to make the lens disappear. It is then possible
to open another 'window-lens' with different dimensions. Thus,
this command can be useful to scan detailed parts of a detector or
to scan hits and showers for events. Clicking the right
button when no lens is displayed will return the control to the
'command mode'. The LENS is also available in sample mode when KSAM is
'ON'.
The following commands will fill a view bank and will
allow to scan the detector and an event previously stored
via the use of LENS (when running
with X-windows):

          1=volume name is visible (default)
         -1=volume invisible with all its descendants in the tree
         -2=volume visible but not its descendants in the tree
 
 'LSTY'   line style 1,2,3,... (default=1)
          LSTY=7 will produce a very precise approximation for
          revolution bodies.
 
 'LWID'   line width -7,...,1,2,3,..7 (default=1)
          LWID<0 will act as abs(LWID) was set for the volume
          and for all the levels below it. When SHAD is 'ON', LWID
          represent the linewidth of the scan lines filling the surfaces
          (whereas the FILL value represent their number). Therefore
          tuning this parameter will help to obtain the desired
          quality/performance ratio.
 
 'COLO'   colour code -166,...,1,2,..166 (default=1)
          n=1=black
          n=2=red;    n=17+m, m=0,25, increasing luminosity according to 'm';

          n=7=lightblue; n=92+m, m=0,25, increasing luminosity according to 'm';
          colour=n*10+m, m=1,2,...9, will produce the same colour
          as 'n', but with increasing luminosity according to 'm';
          COLO<0 will act as if abs(COLO) was set for the volume
          and for all the levels below it.
          When for a volume the attribute FILL is > 1 (and the
          option SHAD is on), the ABS of its colour code must be < 8
          because an automatic shading of its faces will be
          performed.
 
 'FILL'   (1992) fill area  -7,...,0,1,...7 (default=0)
          when option SHAD is 'on' the FILL attribute of any
          volume can be set different from 0 (normal drawing);
          if it is set to 1, the faces of such volume will be filled
          with solid colours; if ABS(FILL) is > 1, then a light
          source is placed along the observer line, and the faces of
          such volumes will be painted by colours whose luminosity
          will depend on the amount of light reflected;
          if ABS(FILL) = 1, then it is possible to use all the 166
          colours of the colour table, becouse the automatic shading
          is not performed;
          for increasing values of FILL the drawing will be performed
          with higher and higher resolution improving the quality (the
          number of scan lines used to fill the faces increases with FILL);
          it is possible to set different values of FILL
          for different volumes, in order to optimize at the same time
          the performance and the quality of the picture;
          FILL<0 will act as if abs(FILL) was set for the volume
          and for all the levels below it.
          This kind of drawing can be saved in 'picture files'
          or in view banks.
          0=drawing without fill area
          1=faces filled with solid colours and resolution = 6
          2=lowest resolution (very fast)

          4=.................
          5=.................
          6=.................
          7=max resolution
          Finally, if a coloured background is desired, the FILL
          attribute for the first volume of the tree must be set
          equal to -abs(colo), colo being >0 and <166.

>Guidance
Call the GEANT initialisation routine GPHYSI to recompute
the tables of cross-sections and energy loss. This command
must be invoked after CUTS, LOSS or ERAN commands.

The routines in the file FNAME will be compiled by COMIS.
If routines with names: UGEOM,GUKINE,GUOUT,UGLAST are found,
then they will be automatically called by GXINT instead of
the routines with the same names compiled with the standard
Fortran compiler and linked with the application.
The user callable routines from the GEANT library as well as
routines from PACKLIB (HBOOK,HPLOT,HIGZ,ZEBRA) may be called
from these user routines. All GEANT common blocks may be
referenced.
In case where the routine UGEOM is called several times,
it is important to DROP all the initialisation data structures
JVOLUM,JMATE,JTMED,etc already in memory by using the routine GIDROP.
 Example of an interactive session where the routine UGEOM is modified:
.
   GEANT > Edit ugeom.for
   GEANT > Fortran ugeom.for
   GEANT > Call GIDROP
   GEANT > Call UGEOM
   GEANT > Dtree
   GEANT > Edit ugeom.for
   GEANT > Fortran ugeom.for
   GEANT > Call GIDROP
   GEANT > Call UGEOM
   GEANT > Dtree
 
If FNAME='-', calls to user routines is reset and standard
routines called instead.
