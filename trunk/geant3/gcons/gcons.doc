*                   Introduction to the section CONS                   *
*                   --------------------------------                   *
*                                                                      *
*   THE SECTION CONS                                                   *
*                                                                      *
*  The  experimental   setup  is  represented  by   a  structure  of   *
* geometrical volumes.  Each volume is  given a medium number by the   *
* user.  Different volumes may have the same medium number [GEOM].     *
*  A  medium is  defined  by  a set  of  parameters, the  so>-called   *
* 'tracking  medium'  parameters,  which include  reference  to  the   *
* material filling the volume.                                         *
*  The tracking  of particles  through an experimental  setup [TRAK]   *
* requires access to the data which describe                           *
*       - the geometrical setup,                                       *
*       - the characteristics of the materials used,                   *
*       - the tracking medium parameters, and                          *
*       - the particle properties.                                     *
*  The section CONS contains all routines related to the storage and   *
* retrieval of information for the materials, the tracking media and   *
* the particles.                                                       *
*                                                                      *
*   MATERIALS                                                          *
*                                                                      *
*  The material  constants are  stored in  the data  structure JMATE   *
* through  the routine  GMATE which  defines the  standard table  of   *
* materials.   They can  be  accessed with  the  routine GFMATE  and   *
* printed with the routine GPMATE.                                     *
*  GMATE calls  the routine GSMATE  for each material in  turn.  The   *
* user may directly use GSMATE instead  of, or in addition to, or to   *
* partly override, GMATE.                                              *
*  MIXTUREs of  basic materials, or COMPOUNDs,  molecules with atoms   *
* from  different basic  materials, may  also be  defined and  their   *
* characteristics  can be  stored  in the  structure JMATE,  through   *
* calls  to the  routine  GSMIXT.  Mixtures  of  compounds are  also   *
* accepted.                                                            *
*  In addition,  some quantities computed during  the initialisation   *
* of the physics processes are stored  in the structure JMATE , such   *
* as energy loss and cross>-section tables [PHYS].                     *
*                                                                      *
* TRACKING MEDIUM PARAMETERS                                           *
*                                                                      *
*  For  each medium  in  turn, the  tracking  medium parameters  are   *
* stored in  the data  structure JTMED  through the  routine GSTMED.   *
* Details about these  parameters are given in [TRAK].   They can be   *
* accessed  with the  routine GFTMED  and printed  with the  routine   *
* GPTMED.                                                              *
*  The correct setting  of the tracking media  parameters is crucial   *
* for the  correctness of the  results of the simulation.   In GEANT   *
* some  of  these parameters  are  calculated  automatically by  the   *
* program by default.  This can be  disabled by the data record AUTO   *
* 0, but only experienced users should use this option.                *
*  The tracking cuts,  the physics cuts and the  flags which control   *
* the physics processes, defined in  GINIT and possibly modified via   *
* the relevant data  cards, are also stored in  the structure JTMED.   *
* Any of  these additional  parameters can  be modified  through the   *
* routine GSTPAR.                                                      *
*                                                                      *
* PARTICLES                                                            *
*                                                                      *
*  The particle  constants are  stored in  the data  structure JPART   *
* through  the routine  GPART which  defines the  standard table  of   *
* particles and, if relevant, the  branching ratios and decay modes.   *
*  The standard particle constants can  be accessed with the routine   *
* GFPART and printed with the routine GPPART.                          *
*  GPART calls the routine GSPART (and GSDK for the decays) for each   *
* particle  in turn.   The user  may call  directly GSPART  and GSDK   *
* instead of, or in addition to, or to partly override, GPART.         *
*                                                                      *
