*
* GEANT 3.21 has a new tracking logic to speed up the search over the
*            volumes positioned inside a given node (Virtual Divisions).
*            The new tracking is initialized by GGCLOS in a completely
*            transparent way and in a negligible amount of time.
*            The GUNEAR and GSORD techniques are automatically disabled
*            and no change in the user code is needed. Anyway, it is
*            still possible to get the old Geant tracking recompiling
*            GEANT and GEANG with the patchy flag OLD.
*            To implement the new logic, the following routines have
*            written or deeply modified: GTNEXT, GGCLOS, GTMEDI, GNEXT,
*            GMEDIA, GINVOL, GVDCAR, GVDRAD, GVDPHI, GVDLIM, GSCVOL.
*                                                               S.Giani.
*
* GEANT 3.21 has a new logic for MANY volumes: the tracking is not
*            based anymore on a step-search, but relies on a algorithm
*            similar to the one used for ONLY volumes (giving then
*            basically the same speed obtained for ONLY). The new logic
*            of MANY allows boolean operations between volumes, clipping
*            of protuding objects, divisions along arbitrary axis,
*            overlaps of 1-D structures to build 2-D or 3-D structures
*            (like honeycombs, spaghetti, etc.). To implement the new
*            logic, the following routines have been written or modified:
*            GTNEXT, GTMEDI, GNEXT, GMEDIA, GTELEC, GTCKOV, GTHADR,
*            GTHION, GTMUON.
*                                                             S.Giani.
*
* GEANT 3.21 contains modifications to GTELEC, GTGAMA, GDRAY in order
*            to exploit the e.m. low energy effects introduced in 3.16
*            without any overhead in performance compared with 3.15.
*            A bug in the delta ray productions is now fixed.
*                                                        Thanks to L.Urban.
*
* GEANT 3.21 provides a ray-tracing as a new visualization tool. The
*            ray-tracing is based on the new Geant tracking and allows
*            the visualization of the boolean operations results.
*            The following routines have been written or modified:
*            GDRACK, GDSTEP, GDNINO, GDOPT, GDRAYT, GDRAW, GDINIT,
*            GTRIG, GTRIGI, GDKINE, GDLUMI, GLIGHT, GFIND, GXDRAW,
*            CDF.
*                                                             S.Giani.
*
* A new GGPERP has been written to cope with almost all the shapes.
*            It is now of general utility both for the Cerenkovs
*            and for the ray-tracing.
*                                               Thanks to R.Jones.
*
* A new set of routines to compute distances to surfaces has been
*            introduced (GVSAFE, GVGRAD, GVPSQR, GVSIGN, GVLONG).
*                                               Thanks to V.Perev.

*        to initialize correctly the link area for the Zebra pointers
*        of the banks relative to straggling, Cerenkovs, Asho, etc.

*
* GPART calls GSDK anyhow to give flexibility at run time (for the interactive
*    version). The values relatives to the particles are now updated to
*    Phys.Rev. D50 1173 1994.
*                                    Thanks to S.Ravndal, F.H.Heinsius.

*
* GBREME and GSYNC (see the new doc for the meaning of sync=0,1,2,3) have
*    been improved and the two relative mechanism can happen at the same time.
*                                    Thanks to M.Maire.
