C**
C**  THE /EVENT COMMON IS THE STACK, WHERE ALL PARTICLES PRODUCED
C**  IN A SHOWER ARE STORED. ONE TRACK HAS 12 LOCATIONS .
C**
C**  NSIZE = TOTAL LENGTH OF THE STACK (TO BE SET IN BLOCK-DATA)
C**  NCUR  = POINTER TO THE TRACK WHICH SHOULD BE COPIED NEXT FROM
C**          THE STACK TO THE RESULT-COMMON.
C**  NEXT  = POINTER TO THE LOCATION WHERE THE NEXT PRODUCED TRACK
C**          SHOULD BE STORED.
C**  NTOT  = TOTAL NUMBER OF TRACKS CURRENTLY STORED.
C**
C**  THE TRACK NEXT TO BE COPIED FROM THE STACK THEN LOOKS LIKE
C**
C**  EVENT(NCUR   ) = X
C**  EVENT(NCUR+ 1) = Y
C**  EVENT(NCUR+ 2) = Z
C**  EVENT(NCUR+ 3) = RCA
C**  EVENT(NCUR+ 4) = RCE
C**  EVENT(NCUR+ 5) = MASS
C**  EVENT(NCUR+ 6) = CHARGE
C**  EVENT(NCUR+ 7) = TOF
C**  EVENT(NCUR+ 8) = PX
C**  EVENT(NCUR+ 9) = PY
C**  EVENT(NCUR+10) = PZ
