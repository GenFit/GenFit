C**   THE BLANK-COMMON IS USED FOR KINEMATIC-CALCULATIONS WITH THE
C**   VECSUB-ROUTINE (2000 WORDS) AND FOR CERN-HBOOK PLOTTING
C**   SYSTEM. IF THE PLOTS ARE FILLED IN THE MEMORY, DO NOT FORGET
C**   A HISTGO(2000)- STATEMENT IN THE ANALYSIS-ROUTINE.
C**   THE DESY-GEP-HBOOK FACILITY DOESN'T USE THE MEMORY, SO THE
C**   BLANK-COMMON MUST ONLY BE INITIALISED FOR 2000 WORDS.
C**   THE NORMAL FILLING OF THE PV-VECTORS IN KINEMATIC CALCULATIONS
C**   ARE AS FOLLOWS:
C**   PV(1,*) = PX  (OR PX/P)
C**   PV(2,*) = PY  (OR PY/P)
C**   PV(3,*) = PZ  (OR PZ/P)
C**   PV(4,*) = ENERGY
C**   PV(5,*) = MASS (SOMETIMES NEGATIVE)
C**   PV(6,*) = CHARGE
C**   PV(7,*) = TIME OF FLIGHT
C**   PV(8,*) = PARTICLE INDEX (SEE #MASIND)
C**   PV(9,*) = 0.
C**   PV(10,*)= USERWORD
