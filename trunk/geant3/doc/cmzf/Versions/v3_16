*    The GEANT-FLUKA interface                                         *
*                                                                      *
*    Since version  3.15, GEANT  includes an interface  with some      *
*    FLUKA [1,2,3,4,5] routines. This  part has been  updated and      *
*    extended in subsequent releases.                                  *
*                                                                      *
*    FLUKA is  a standalone code with  its own life.  Only  a few      *
*    parts have been included into GEANT, namely the ones dealing      *
*    with hadronic elastic and inelastic interactions.                 *
*                                                                      *
*    The  implementation  of FLUKA  routines  in  GEANT does  not      *
*    include  any change,  apart  from interface  ones and  those      *
*    agreed by the FLUKA authors.  Whenever different options are      *
*    available in  FLUKA, the one  suggested by the  authors have      *
*    been retained.  Nevertheless the results obtained with FLUKA      *
*    routines  inside GEANT  could not  be representative  of the      *
*    full  FLUKA performances,  since  they  generally depend  on      *
*    other parts which are GEANT specific.                             *
*                                                                      *
*    The routines made available  for GEANT have been extensively      *
*    tested  and  are reasonably  robust.   They  usually do  not      *
*    represent the latest FLUKA developments, since the policy is      *
*    to supply  for GEANT  well tested  and reliable  code rather      *
*    than very  recent developments with possibly  better physics      *
*    but also still undetected errors.                                 *
*                                                                      *
*    It is important that GEANT users are aware of the conditions      *
*    at which this code has been kindly made available:                *
*                                                                      *
*     o  relevant   authorship   and   references   about   FLUKA      *
*        [1,2,3,4,5]   should  be   clearly   indicated  in   any      *
*        publication reporting results obtained with this code;        *
*                                                                      *
*     o  the FLUKA authors reserve  the right of publishing about      *
*        the  physical  models  they  developed  and  implemented      *
*        inside FLUKA,  GEANT users  are not supposed  to extract      *
*        from  the  GEANT  -  FLUKA code  the  relevant  routines      *
*        running them standalone for benchmarks;                       *
*                                                                      *
*     o  more generally,  FLUKA routines  contained in  the GEANF      *
*        file are  supposed to  be included  and used  with GEANT      *
*        only:  any other  use must  be authorised  by the  FLUKA      *
*        authors.                                                      *
