The tar file includes:
  -the new version of Geant3.21 that includes several bug fixes
   compared to the standard version in CERNLIB.
   In this version all Geant3 gxxxxx routines have been renamed g3xxxxx.
   run make in this directory. The Makefile will compile all Geant
   routines and a shared lib lib/tgt_Linux/libgeant321.so will be created.

  -The directory TGeant3 contains the class TGeant3 as well as a few
   examples like gexam1, gexam3, gexam4 and model, plus the macros
   E01.C, E02.C
   By default, TGeant3 is compiled with the option "WITHG3".
   Specify -DWITHROOT in the compile options to select the ROOT geometry.
   When the option WITHROOT is selected, TGeant3 will be generated
   with calls to the Root geometry package only.
   When the option WITHG3 is selected (default), TGeant3 will be generated
   to use the Geant3 geometry package only.
   Option WITHBOTH selects the two packages (only interesting to compare
   the response from G3 compared to ROOT).

To build the examples gexam1,3 and 4 run the scripts bind_gexam1,3,4
bind_gexam1
gexam1
read 4
stop
root >  gMC->ProcessRun(10)
root > .q

same for gexam3,4, model.

to run the E01.C, E02.C and E03.C examples (common to Geant3 and 4), do
root > .x E01.C

This script requires the geant4_vmc file in a separate tar file.
