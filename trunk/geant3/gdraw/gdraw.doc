*             Introduction to the Drawing package                      *
*             -----------------------------------                      *
*                                                                      *
*                                                                      *
* THE DRAWING PACKAGE                                                  *
*                                                                      *
* The drawing package has been designed mainly to:                     *
*                                                                      *
* - draw the detector                                                  *
* - draw the detector geometrical tree                                 *
* - draw particle trajectories                                         *
* - draw hits.                                                         *
*                                                                      *
*  DRAWING THE DETECTOR                                                *
*                                                                      *
*  The detector  can be looked at  from any view point  and with any   *
* scale factor (GDRAW, GDRVOL); appropriate attributes can be set in   *
* order to see  only selected objects (so  avoiding messy pictures);   *
* hidden line removal is available as well as surface shading.         *
*  'Cut'  views,  i.e.  intersections  of a  given  plane  with  the   *
* detector, can also be displayed (GDRAWC, GDRAWX).  This feature is   *
* very useful to  see internal details that the  routine GDRAW would   *
* not show.                                                            *
*  When hidden line  removal is used, the possibility  exists to cut   *
* the volume to be drawn with various shapes, to visualise the inner   *
* details.                                                             *
*                                                                      *
* DRAWING THE GEOMETRICAL TREE                                         *
*                                                                      *
*  The geometrical tree (GDTREE) is  a representation of the overall   *
* structure of the detector, namely the mother-daughter relationship   *
* among  the  various  objects   composing  it.   Several  types  of   *
* additional information are available on request: multiplicity of a   *
* given  volume (i.e.  how  many  times it  is  positioned in  other   *
* places, or  number of  subdivisions), detector  nature, visibility   *
* flag, etc.  This  drawing tree capability can be  very useful when   *
* tuning  the  detector  geometry.    If  used  interactively,  this   *
* facility  allow to  invoke via  a click  of the  mouse the  GDSPEC   *
* utility (see below) for any node of the tree.                        *
*                                                                      *
* DRAWING THE GEOMETRICAL SPECIFICATIONS                               *
*                                                                      *
*  The geometrical  specifications (GDSPEC) give a  detailed picture   *
* of one  particular piece of  the detector.  Three drawings  of the   *
* volume (a projection  view and two cut views), its  shape type and   *
* numerical  parameters  (i.e.  dimensions),  and  a  scale  to  aid   *
* geometric  calculations,  are  presented   together  in  a  single   *
* graphics frame.  The set of  geometrical specifications of all the   *
* descendants of  a given node on  the tree, can easily  be obtained   *
* with the routine GDFSPC.                                             *
*                                                                      *
* DRAWING PARTICLE TRAJECTORIES                                        *
*                                                                      *
*  The tracks generated  by the tracking package, and  stored in the   *
* data structure JXYZ, can be easily drawn with the routine GDXYZ.     *
*  The names of the particles and/or  the track numbers can be drawn   *
* as well (GDPART).                                                    *
*  Four types of representations are  used to display the classes of   *
* particles, with different colour and line style:                     *
*                                                                      *
* - red solid lines for charged particles (GTELEC, GTHADR)             *
* - green dashed lines for muons (GTMUON)                              *
* - black blank/dotted lines for neutral particles (GTNEUT)            *
* - blue dotted lines for gammas (GTGAMA)                              *
*                                                                      *
*  A special routine has been  provided to display the tracks online   *
* (GDCXYZ), if  called under  the DEBUG/SWITCH control  from GUSTEP.   *
* That routine  shows the tracks exactly  at the same time  they are   *
* trasorted by  the tracking package  of GEANT3, giving so  a useful   *
* interactive debugging tool.                                          *
*                                                                      *
* DRAWING HITS                                                         *
*                                                                      *
*  The hits generated by the tracking package and stored in the        *
* data structure JHITS, can be displayed by the hits routines,         *
* with different functionality:                                        *
*                                                                      *
* - draw one hit (GDAHIT); called by user routines                     *
* - draw all the hits of trajectory type sets/detectors (GDHITS)       *
* - draw all the hits of calorimeter type sets/detectors (GDCHIT)      *
*                                                                      *
*  Different symbols for every subdetector can be used, chosen among   *
* hardware characters  (dots), software  crosses, or from  the HPLOT   *
* table of software characters.  The size of the software characters   *
* and crosses is given as an  argument to GDAHIT/GDHITS, while it is   *
* computed as a function of the hits value in GDCHIT.                  *
*                                                                      *
* THE VIEW BANKS                                                       *
*                                                                      *
*  The basic detector drawing  routines (GDRAW, GDRAWC, GDRAWX) have   *
* to scan the  data structure JVOLUM repeatedly.   When the detector   *
* is  described in  a  very  detailed way,  the  time  spent in  the   *
* interpretation of  the JVOLUM bank  and in the  3D transformations   *
* can  increase dramatically.   For a  detector with  more than  100   *
* different volume names, for example, this time can reach real time   *
* minutes on some machines, whereas  the specific time required just   *
* by the  drawing would be only  a few seconds.  If  the hidden line   *
* removal option is active, this  time can reach several minutes and   *
* even  hours,  depending  on  the  speed of  the  machine  and  the   *
* complexity of the drawing requested.                                 *
*  In order to alleviate this  problem the 'bank-mode' routines have   *
* been developed.  The basic idea  is to separate the interpretation   *
* (i.e. the  JVOLUM scanning  to convert  the 3D  geometry structure   *
* into a set of 2D lines) from the drawing itself.  In this way, the   *
* interpretation is performed  only once and all  the 2D information   *
* is stored in view banks  (data structure JDRAW) [DRAW 399].  These   *
* views can then be looked at in  a quicker way, having only to draw   *
* all 2D vectors  previously stored.  For a detector  with more than   *
* 100 different volume  names, for example, this is  achieved at the   *
* cost of only a few thousand words of memory for each view bank.      *
*  One  can therefore  open a  view bank  (GDOPEN), identified  by a   *
* number, perform appropriate drawings  (only interpretation will be   *
* made, of course), close the bank  (GDCLOS) and finally look at the   *
* picture stored in  it (GDSHOW).  When a view bank  has been closed   *
* it cannot  be modified anymore,  but it  can be displayed  as many   *
* times as wanted (GDSHOW) or deleted (GDELET).                        *
*                                                                      *
* OTHER FEATURES                                                       *
*                                                                      *
*  The user can  control some drawing options  (GDOPT), by selecting   *
* for instance  to have  either parallel or  perspective projection,   *
* either  Y-Z  or  R-Z  projection,  hidden  line  removal,  surface   *
* shading, etc.                                                        *
*  There is  a routine (GDZOOM) that,  if called, applies a  zoom to   *
* everything (volumes, tracks, hits, etc.)  will be drawn from then.   *
* This feature, in conjunction  with the interactive command MEASURE   *
* [XINT 110], can be used for detailed viewing.                        *
*  Another  tool that  could help  in the  interactive debugging  or   *
* tuning of the detector geometry  is the routine GEDITV [DRAW 600],   *
* by which it  is possible to modify  interactively some geometrical   *
* parameters  set  by  the   user  routines  defining  the  detector   *
* geometry.                                                            *
*  It is possible to draw the axes of the 3D MAster Reference System   *
* (GDAXIS) oriented in agreement with the current view point.          *
*  Two other  routines draw a scale  (GDSCAL) or a profile  of a man   *
* (GDMAN) in 2D  user coordinates to give an idea  of the dimensions   *
* within current scale  factors.  A 2D text  (GDRAWT) using software   *
* characters (hardware  characters should be implemented  later on),   *
* 2D vectors (GDRAWV) or a frame header (GDHEAD) are also available.   *
*  Attributes  like colour  (GDCOL)  and line  width  (GDLW) can  be   *
* globally set for all 2D  drawings (i.e. text, vectors, man, etc.);   *
* they are overridden in 3D drawings by volume attributes set by the   *
* GSATT routine with 'COLO' or 'LWID' option.                          *
*  A  graphics input  is available  (GDCURS)  to fetch  the 2D  user   *
* coordinates  of the  graphics cursor  on the  screen, allowing  an   *
* immediate user  interface with the interactive  version of GEANT3.   *
* In  particular there  are interactive  commands to  zoom, measure,   *
* pick tracks or hits points that make use of that routine.            *
*  Various conversions from  3D to 3D, and 3D to  2D coordinates are   *
* performed by GDFR3D and GD3D3D.                                      *
*                                                                      *
* BASIC AND ADVANCED GRAPHICS                                          *
*                                                                      *
*  The  underlying graphics  system  is completely  hidden from  the   *
* GEANT program.  All  graphics call are made via  the HIGZ package.   *
* Various implementations of the HIGZ package are available, notably   *
* for X11, GKS, DI3000 and, shortly, PHIGS.                            *
*                                                                      *
*  RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS                                                *
*                                                                      *
*  Thanks to the HIGZ package,  it is possible to produce postscript   *
* metafiles from the drawings.  When  the GKS implementation of HIGZ   *
* is used, the possibility is there  to produce also a GKS metafile.   *
*                                                                      *
* SUMMARY                                                              *

*  The drawing package is initialized by (in the order):               *
*  IGINIT    to initialize the HIGZ package and the underlying basic   *
