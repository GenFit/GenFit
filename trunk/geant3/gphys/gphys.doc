*                  Introduction to the section PHYS                    *
*                  --------------------------------                    *
*                                                                      *
*                                                                      *
* THE PHYSICS PROCESSES                                                *
*                                                                      *
*  The processes  currently implemented in GEANT3  can be classified   *
* as follows:                                                          *
*                                                                      *
* - Decays in flight                                                   *
* - Multiple scattering (Gaussian or Moliere)                          *
* - Continuous electromagnetic processes                               *
* - Discrete electromagnetic processes                                 *
* - Hadronic interactions                                              *
* - Muon nucleus-interactions.                                         *
*                                                                      *
*  The  fist  two  are  controlled  by  the  routines  GDECAY  which   *
* generates the decay products and  GMULTS which computes the change   *
* in  the angle  due to  multiple scattering  over a  given tracking   *
* step.   The  others  are  reviewed  separately  in  the  following   *
* paragraphs.                                                          *
*  For  convenience the  particles are  given a  'tracking type'  in   *
* GEANT, depending on their interaction with matter:                   *
*                                                                      *
*   ITRTYP = 1  photon                                                 *
*            2  electron and positron                                  *
*            3  neutral particles                                      *
*            4  charged hadrons                                        *
*            5  muon                                                   *
*            6  'Geantino'                                             *
*            7  Cerenkov photon                                        *
*            8  Ion                                                    *
*                                                                      *
*  The  paragraph  5  gives  a  summary  of  the  physics  processes   *
* activated for  each type  of particle with  the momentum  range of   *
* validity when relevant.  GPHYSI controls the initialisation of the   *
* various processes.                                                   *
*                                                                      *
* CONTINUOUS ELECTROMAGNETIC PROCESSES                                 *
*                                                                      *
* GMOLI     Initializes Moliere scattering                             *
* GPROBI    initializes material 'constants'  used for computing the   *
*           probability of various interactions.                       *
* GDRELA    Control routine  to fill   DE/DX tables for  energy loss   *
*           due to ionisation.                                         *
* GDRELP    Calculates  energy loss  due to  ionisation for  charged   *
*           particles other than electrons and positrons.              *
* GDRELE    Calculates energy  loss due to ionisation  for electrons   *
*           and  positrons.  As  Moller  and  Bhabba scattering  are   *
*           treated  as discrete  processes the  energy loss  due to   *
*           ionisation is a function  of the electron kinetic energy   *
*           cut-off DCUTE below which these processes are treated as   *
*           a continuous energy loss [BASE 030, common /GCPHYS/].      *
* GBRELA    Initializes   Bremsstrahlung  cross-section   and  fills   *
*           energy  loss tables  for Bremsstrahlung.   Both formulae   *
*           depend on  the photon  energy cut-off BCUTE  below which   *
*           Bremsstrahlung is  treated as  a continuous  energy loss   *
*           [BASE 030, common /GCPHYS/].                               *
* GPRELA    Fills  DE/DX  tables  for  energy loss  by  direct  pair   *
*           production  for high  energy  muons.  The  corresponding   *
*           discrete process is not considered.                        *
* GRANGI    Calculates    the    stopping     range    tables    for   *
*           electron/positron, muon and proton.                        *
* GMULOF    Calculates the tables for the maximum step allowed to to   *
*           continuous processes: Bending  in magnetic field, energy   *
*           loss and multiple scattering.                              *
* GCOEFF    Calculates  the   interpolation  coefficients   for  the   *
*           energy/Range relation  to be used in  the calculation of   *
*           the energy loss.                                           *
*                                                                      *
* DISCRETE ELECTROMAGNETIC PROCESSES                                   *
*                                                                      *
*   For the simulation of each  given discrete physics process three   *
* tasks have to be performed:                                          *
*                                                                      *
* - The evaluation  of the step  length.  This is computed  from the   *
*   updated  probability for  the  occurrence of  the process.   The   *
*   corresponding code  has been  inserted directly in  the tracking   *
*   routines for each tracking type as appropriate.                    *
* - After transport  of the  particle, the  generation of  the final   *
*   state particles (GEANT routines GPHOT, GCOMP, etc.)                *
* - If the  particle survives  after the interaction,  recompute the   *
*   probability.                                                       *
*                                                                      *
*   It should be outlined that the  evaluation of the step length is   *
* made independently  for each  process which  can occur,  the final   *
* step  size  being the  minimum  of  all  and the  process  finally   *
* considered being the corresponding one.                              *
*                                                                      *
