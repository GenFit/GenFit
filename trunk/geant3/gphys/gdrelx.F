C.    *  Calculates the mean 1/DENS*dE/dx of a particle with kinetic   *
C.    *  energy T in an element of atomic number Z, atomic weight A    *
C.    *  and density DENS ( the density is just used for the           *
C.    *  calculation of the density effect in the case of high T).     *
C.    *  The routine reproduces the experimental and/or tabulated      *
C.    *  energy losses rather well down to T -> 0.                     *
C.    *  Simple parametrization is used for  T .le. T2L=2 MeV (see     *
C.    *  H.H.Andersen,J.F.Ziegler:Hydrogen stopping powers and         *
C.    *  ranges in all element,Pergamon Press,1977.).                  *
C.    *  For T .gt. T2L=2 MeV the corrected Bethe-Bloch stopping       *
C.    *  power / restricted energy loss formula is used.               *
