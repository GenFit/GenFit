*                                                                      *

* THE DETECTOR RESPONSE PACKAGE                                        *
*                                                                      *
* In the context of GEANT3:                                            *
*                                                                      *
* - a hit is  the user defined 'quantum of  information' recorded at   *
*   tracking  time to  keep  track of  the  interaction between  one   *
*   particle  and  a  given  sensitive  detector,  and  regarded  as   *
*   necessary to compute the digitisations later.                      *
*                                                                      *
* - a  digitisation is  the  user defined  'quantum of  information'   *
*   simulating  the  response of  a  given  detector element,  after   *
*   tracking  of a  complete event.                                    *
*                                                                      *
*  The detector response package consists  of tools to store in, and   *
* retrieve or print from, the  data structures JSET, JHITS and JDIGI   *
* the information  relevant to  the hits  and digitisations.   A few   *
* subroutines which  may help the  user to  solve some of  the usual   *
* problems of  digitisation in simple  detectors have been  added to   *
* the package,  e.g. the intersection of  a track with a  plane or a   *
* cylinder  and  the  digitisation  of conventional  drift  and  MWP   *
* chambers.                                                            *
*  For complex  set-ups with different  types of detectors  the user   *
* has normally  to define several  types of hits  and digitisations.   *
* In addition to the hits generated  by all particles of the current   *
* event,   computing  the   digitisations   requires  usually   some   *
* information about the intrinsic characteristics and performance of   *
* the detectors.                                                       *
*  The information to be recorded  for the hits and digitisations is   *
* highly  experiment dependent,  therefore only  a framework  can be   *
* proposed  to  store  it.   The solution  adopted  here  should  be   *
* satisfactory  for most  of  the applications.   Feedback from  the   *
* users is needed and will be welcome.                                 *
*  Two remarks can be made:                                            *
*                                                                      *
* - the stability of the information to be stored is usually reached   *
*   much earlier for the hits than for the digitisations.  Therefore   *
*   the user  may save computing  time by designing  an intermediate   *
*   event output at the hits level.                                    *
* - the scheme proposed for storing  the digitisations should in any   *
*   case be considered  as an intermediate stage,   a reshuffling of   *
*   the data  being necessary  if the  user wants  to simulate  more   *
*   closely the specific format of the real data acquisition system.   *
*                                                                      *
* SETS AND DETECTORS                                                   *
*                                                                      *
* The reader is assumed to be  familiar with the way the geometrical   *
* setup is described [GEOM 001],  in particular with the concepts of   *
* logical volume structure  and of physical path  through the volume   *
* tree.                                                                *
*  The  user  is  required  to  classify  into  sets  all  sensitive   *
* detectors for which  storing the hits in the  data structure JHITS   *
* is wanted.                                                           *
*  The 4-character names  which identify the sets  are user defined,   *
* and the list of sets which the  user wants to activate for a given   *
* run  can be  entered  through the  data card  SETS.   The user  is   *
* entirely  free to  group  together,  in one  or  in several  sets,   *
* detectors  of   the  same  type   or  of  different   types.   For   *
* convenience, it is  recommended to have at least one  set for each   *
* main   component  of   the   setup,   e.g.  hadron   calorimeters,   *
* electromagnetic calorimeters, vertex chamber, etc.                   *
*   A detector  can be  declared as  sensitive through  the tracking   *
* medium  parameter  ISVOL,  and  allocated to  a  set  through  the   *
* subroutine GSDET.   Currently, the active sets  and detectors have   *
* to be  redefined for every run.   Tools will be provided  later to   *
* read in part  or the whole of the information  from a previous run   *
* and  to  update the  relevant  structures  according to  the  user   *
* requirements.                                                        *
*   Each (logical) detector is identified by the 4-character name of   *
* the corresponding volume.  As a  given volume may describe several   *
* similar  detectors   of  the   physical  setup,   some  additional   *
* information is needed for associating  correctly the hits with the   *
* physical detectors.  The user has  to enter the (shortest) list of   *
* volume names,  the vector NAMESV, which  permits identification of   *
* the  path through  the  physical  tree, even  in  the presence  of   *
* multiple copies at  the volume level or at any  lower level in the   *
* tree.   The  identification  will  be  achieved  when  needed,  by   *
* specifying a list  of volume numbers, the vector NUMBV,  in one to   *
* one  correspondence with  the above  list of  volume names.   This   *
* list,  after  packing,  will  constitute  the  identifier  of  the   *
* physical detector.                                                   *
*                                                                      *
* THE BASIC USER TOOLS                                                 *
*                                                                      *
* The  data structure  JSET is  built through  calls to  the routine   *
* GSDET  which  allocates  detectors   to  sets  and  defines  their   *
* parameters,  and  to the  auxiliary  routines  GSDETH, GSDETD  and   *
* GSDETU which  store respectively in  the structure JSET,  for each   *
* logical detector separately:                                         *
*                                                                      *
* - the parameters required  for the storage of the  hit elements in   *
*   the  data  structure JHITS,  such  as  the packing  and  scaling   *
*   conventions.                                                       *
*                                                                      *
* - the parameters required for the  storage of the digitisations in   *
*   the structure JDIGI,  such as the packing  conventions. the user   *
*   parameters, which  may consist,  for instance, of  the intrinsic   *
*   detector characteristics needed for computing the digitisations.   *
*                                                                      *
*  To  permit storage  of more  than  one type  of hit  for a  given   *
* sensitive  detector, detector  'aliases'  can  be defined  through   *
* calls  to  the routine  GSDETA.   They  are  entered in  the  JSET   *
* structure  as  additional  detectors, with  the  same  geometrical   *
* characteristics  as the  original  one.  Then,  the  user has  the   *
* possibility to  call the  appropriate routines GSDETH,  GSDETD and   *
* GSDETU.                                                              *
*  During  the   tracking,  for  each  step   inside  the  sensitive   *
* detectors, under control of the subroutine GUSTEP, the hits can be   *
* stored in the data structure  JHITS with the subroutine GSAHIT (or   *
* GSCHIT,  more  appropriate for  calorimetry).   For  each hit  the   *
* information consists of:                                             *
*                                                                      *
* - the reference to the track in the structure JKINE,                 *
* - the packed identifier of the physical detector, and                *
* - the packed data for the different elements of the hit.             *
*                                                                      *
*  When  the tracking  has been  completed for  the whole  event the   *
* digitisations can be computed in  the user subroutine GUDIGI which   *
* may  extract the  hits with  the subroutine  GFHITS and  store the   *
* digitisations  in the  data structure  JDIGI, with  the subroutine   *
* GSDIGI.   For each  digitisation the  information should  at least   *
* consist of:                                                          *
*                                                                      *
* - the reference to the track(s),                                     *
* - the packed identifier of the physical detector, and                *
* - the packed data for the digitisation itself.                       *
*                                                                      *
* RETRIEVAL OF GEOMETRICAL INFORMATION                                 *
*                                                                      *
*  The packed  identifier of as  physical detector stored a  part of   *
* the hit  (or digitisation) information, is  returned (unpacked) by   *
* the routines GFHITS  or GFDIGI which extract  the information from   *
* the JHITS  or JDIGI structures,  and may  be used to  retrieve the   *
* identity and geometrical characteristics of the given detector.      *
*   At  the  moment this  is  automatized  through  the use  of  the   *
* routines GFPATH  (which assumes that the  sensitive detectors have   *
* been declared  through the routine  GSDETV, not GSDET)  and GLVOLU   *
* which fills the common /GCVOLU/.                                     *
*   GFPATH prepares the lists LNAM  and LNUM required by the routine   *
* GLVOLU [GEOM 001].                                                   *
*   Worth  is in  progress in  this area  and might  lead to  a more   *
* transparent approach.  Therefore, the  routines GSDETV, GGDETV and   *
* GFPATH  and  their action  on  the  structure  JSETS will  not  be   *
* documented in more detail now.                                       *
*                                                                      *
