*                       The I/O service routines                       *
*                       ------------------------                       *
*                                                                      *
*  The  I/O routines  permit  to  read and  write,  the GEANT3  data   *
* structures.   The  possibility  exists  to  write  and  read  data   *
* structures to/from  direct access  files, in machine  dependent or   *
* independent format  and to/from direct  access files.  All  I/O is   *
* done via the  ZEBRA I/O routines both for direct  access files (FZ   *
* package) and for direct access files (RZ package).                   *
*  Data can  be generated on one  type of machine, for  example full   *
* detector simulation,  and the data  produced can be analyzed  on a   *
* different machine.                                                   *
*  The data structures written to tape or disk can be read either in   *
* whole or in part.                                                    *
