/** @brief Base Class for representing a Hit in GENFIT
 *
 *  @author Christian H&ouml;ppner (Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen, original author)
 *  @author Sebastian Neubert  (Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen, original author)
 * 
 * A hit is defined as a single measurement of a detector. Each detector can 
 * define it's own hit representation (geometry) by inherting from GFAbsRecoHit. 
 * We call such a child object a "RecoHit" to make clear that
 * it inherits from GFAbsRecoHit.
 * All detector specific information is handled inside the RecoHit objects.
 * The idea behind this is that the fitting algorithms can work on different
 * detectors simultanously. 
 *
 * GFAbsRecoHit defines the basic interface that is used by all genfit algorithms
 * to access hit-measurement information. It provides:
 *  - the matrices to store hit coordinates and covariances
 *  - defines methods to access these data
 *  - the interface to access a hit's detector plane object
 * 
 * All hits have to inherit from this base class. 
 * Inheritance can be direct or through template class 
 * RecoHitIfc<GeometryPolicy>.
 * These interface classes (defined with a specific policy)
 * provide additional functionality for specific hit geometries, 
 * such as space points, wires, etc. For details look 
 * at the RecoHitIfc documentation.
 * 
 * A simple example is given in VirtSpacePointRecoHit
 *
 * Background information: The main feature here is
 * that coordinates and covariances are available as general 
 * TMatrixT<double> objects. By using these general algebraic 
 * objects it is possible to abstract from the concrete measurement and 
 * thus define a unified framework to handle the data. This is a key ingredient
 * for the separation of data and algorithms which in turn enables us 
 * to elegantly combine information from different detectors.

   * This is a virtual abstract method which has to be implemented in the child
   * classes.
   *
   * In general there is a linear transformation between the coordinate system
   * of the hit (which is defined by the detector plane) and the coordinates of
   * the track representation in that plane. In the most simple case the track
   * representation has 5 parameters (space + momentum) 
   * while a hit usually has less (one to three space coordinates). 
   *
   * The transformation matrix is then simply projecting out the 
   * space-components of the track representation.
   *
   * Its dimensions are NxM. Where N is the number of dimensions of the 
   * hit in the detector plane (usually 2 or 1) and M is the dimension of the
   * track representation.
   *
   * In this method a hit has to define with which track representations it can
   * work together. It should be the only point where this explicit 
   * coordination is necessary. 
   *
   * For example code see implementing classes below:

   * a plane that is perpendicular to the current track, since in that case no 
   * other plane is predefined.
   *
   * There are several implementations for this method in the HitPolicies. 
   * In the most simple case (a planar detector) the method just returns a
   * fixed (detector module specific) plane. This behaviour for example is 
   * implemented in PlanarHitPolicy.
