		/** @brief Get the measurement m,V
		 *
		 * Due to the nature of the GFDafHit, the coordinates returned are not 
		 * necessarily the coordinates of the real hits. There are two cases:
		 * if the GFDafHit contains only one hit, then the hit coordinates of
		 * this hit are returned. If however, the GFDafHit contains several hits,
		 * then the following formula is used to obtain the hit coordinates:
		 * \f[
		 * \mathbf{m} = \mathbf{V} \cdot \sum_{i}p_{i}\cdot \mathbf{V}_{i}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{m}_{i}
		 * \f]
		 * with \f$\mathbf{m_{i}}\f$ the real hit coordinates, \f$\mathbf{V}_{i}\f$ 
		 * the real hit covariance and \f$p_{i}\f$ the weights. The sum runs over
		 * all real hits in the GFDafHit. \f$\mathbf{V}\f$ is the effective hit
		 * covariance as returned by getHitCov(). This calculation is only done,
		 * if the plane has changed from the last time gitHitCoord() was called.
		 *
		 * And now for the covariance matrix:
		 * There are two cases as well: if the GFDafHit contains
		 * only one hit, the covariance is calculated like:
		 * \f[
		 * \mathbf{V} = \frac{1}{p_{1}}\cdot\mathbf{V}_{1}
		 * \f]
		 * with the symbols analog to getHitCoord().
		 * If there are several hits in the GFDafHit, the following formula is
		 * used:
		 * \f[
		 * \mathbf{V} = \left( \sum_{i} p_{i} \cdot \left( \mathbf{V}_{i}\right)^{-1} \right)^{-1}
		 * \f]
		 * As before, these calculations are only done if the plane is different
		 * from the one getHitCov was last called.
