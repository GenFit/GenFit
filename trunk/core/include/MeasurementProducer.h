/** @brief Template class for a measurement producer module
 *
 * A MeasurementProducer module is used by MeasurementFactory to create Measurements for
 * one specific detector type.
 *
 * It is assumed that each detector has as output of its digitization /
 * clustering some sort of hit or cluster class which stores all information that
 * corresponds to a measured hit in that detector. The MeasurementProducer
 * converts this information into a class that can be handled by genfit.
 * This class is realized as a Measurement (a class inheriting from AbsMeasurement).
 *
 * In order to use the MeasurementProducer facility, a
 * Measurement has to implement a constructor which takes as an argument
 * a pointer to the cluster class and a TrackCandHit. This constructor serves as the initializing
 * constructor for the Measurement.
 *
 * The MeasurementProducer will fetch the cluster objects from a TClonesArray and
 * use the initializing constructor to build the corresponding Measurement.
 *
 * @param hit_t template parameter specifying hit/cluster class
 * @param measurement_T template parameter specifying Measurement
