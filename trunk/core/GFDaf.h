/** @brief Determinstic Annealing Filter (DAF) implementation. 
 *
 * @author Christian H&ouml;ppner (Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen, original author)
 * @author Karl Bicker (Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen)
 *
 * The DAF is an iterative Kalman filter with annealing. It is capable of 
 * fitting tracks which are contaminated with noise hits. The algorithm is 
 * taken from the references R. Fruehwirth & A. Strandlie, Computer Physics 
 * Communications 120 (1999) 197-214 and CERN thesis: Dissertation by Matthias 
 * Winkler.
 *
 * The weights which were assigned to the hits by the DAF are accessible by using the
 * bookkeeping object of the fitted track. The weight is stored under the key "dafWeight".
 * So to retrieve for example the weight of hit 10, fitted with track representation 2,
 * use GFTrack::getBK(2)->getNumber("dafWeight", 10,  double& wght).

		 * The DAF uses special effective hits defined in the class GFDafHit. A
		 * GFDafHit is a wrapper class and contains all the real hits from one plane.
		 * The structure of the return vector of getWeights allows to reconstruct in
		 * what way the hits were grouped: the outermost vector represents the track
		 * representation, there is one entry per track representation. The middle
		 * vector represents the effective hits, and the innermost vector contains
		 * the real hits contained in the corresponding effective hit.
