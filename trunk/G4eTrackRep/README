***WARNING: This is a very early version!***
It does not work properly yet.

To use the G4eTrackRep, you need to install Geant4 first.
 - make sure that Geant4 you've built with 'All headers in one directory' option
   (if $G4INSTALL/include is empty, you propably didn't)
 - make sure the environment for Geant4 is set (source 'env.sh' in the $G4INSTALL folder)
